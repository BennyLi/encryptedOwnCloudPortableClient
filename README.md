# Encrypted ownCloud Portable Client

This is a portable ownCloud client that runs on Windows.
At starttime a Batch file is executed and will prompt you for a password.
On first run this will set your password to encrypt the ownCloud client configuration (host, user, password) and the data stored in your portable `Documents` folder.

**ATTENTION**: This currently only works if used inside a complete PortableApps setup like used on USB sticks with the following directory structure:
```
X:\
   Documents\
       ownCloud\          <-- This folder will be generated by the script
   PortableApps\
       ownCloudPortable\  <-- Put the contents of this repository here
```
A setup with the PortableApps directories not at the root of a drive is not yet tested.

## Used software

### PortableApps ownCloud package
I used the PortableApps Stub from http://portableapps.com/node/37132. Thanks to the author.

### ownCloud
Currently packaged is the ownCloud client version 1.8.0 (build 4893) from https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients.

### 7-Zip
For encrypted packaging a 7za.exe is included. This is the official portable one in version 9.38 beta from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html.

If you ask yourself if 7-Zip is secure enough, please reefer to http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29375/is-7-zips-aes-encryption-just-as-secure-as-truecrypts-version.

### Bat To Exe Converter
To convert the start.bat to .exe I used Bat To Exe Converter version 2.2.0.0 from http://www.f2ko.de/en/b2e.php.
Currently I need an .exe file because the PortableApps Launcher cannot handle .bat files with the [WaitForEXEN](http://portableapps.com/manuals/PortableApps.comLauncher/ref/launcher.ini/launch.html#waitforexen) setting.
